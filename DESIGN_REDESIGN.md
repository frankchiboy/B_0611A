# Visual Redesign Plan

This document proposes a complete redesign of all visible aspects of the project. Sample HTML and CSS files (index.html and style.css) demonstrate these concepts in practice.

## Layout
- Adopt a responsive grid layout optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- Use consistent spacing and alignment based on a 4px baseline grid.
- Keep key actions and navigation elements accessible within the top or bottom bars.

## Color Scheme
- Accent color: `#6FFFB0` (mint green) for secondary highlights.
- Primary color: `#1F6FEB` (vibrant blue) for highlights and buttons.
- Secondary color: `#FFD300` (warm yellow) to draw attention to important elements.
- Neutral colors: shades of gray ranging from `#FAFAFA` to `#333333` for backgrounds and text.
- Use gradients sparingly to maintain a modern flat design aesthetic.

## Transparency
- Employ subtle transparency effects (`0.9` to `0.8` opacity) for overlay panels and modal backgrounds to create depth without overwhelming content.
- Avoid excessive translucency that may hinder readability.

## Typography
- Headings: `Roboto` or a similar sans-serif font, using bold weights for emphasis.
- Body text: `Open Sans` or another clean sans-serif font for readability.
- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background for accessibility compliance.

## Imagery and Icons
- Use 24px icon grid for consistency across the interface.
- Use vector-based icons with a consistent line weight. Prefer open-source icon sets such as Font Awesome or Feather Icons.
- Ensure images are optimized for web performance. Consider using `webp` format where supported.
- Establish a cohesive illustration style: flat graphics with minimal shading.

## Future Implementation Notes
- As the project grows, incorporate a style guide or CSS framework (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap) to enforce visual consistency.
- Keep components modular to allow easy theme adjustments if design requirements evolve.
